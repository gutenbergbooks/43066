<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">An idle story with an idle moral!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do I tell it, at the risk of quarrel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With nobler themes? The world, alas! is so,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who would gather truth must bend him low,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor fear to soil his knees with graveyard ground,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If haply there some flower of truth be found.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For human nature is an earthy fruit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Mired at the stem and fleshy at the root,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thrives with folly's mixon best o'erlaid,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor less divinely so, when all is said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brave lives are lived, and worthy deeds are done<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each virtuous day, 'neath the all-pitying sun;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
<span class="i0">But these are not the most, perhaps not even<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The surest road to our soul's modern heaven.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The best of us are creatures of God's chance<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Call it His grace), which works deliverance;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest mere pendulums 'twixt good and ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like soldiers marking time while standing still.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Tis all their strategy, who have lost faith<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In things Divine beyond man's life and death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleasure and pain. Of heaven what know we,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Save as unfit for angels' company,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Say rather hell's? We cling to sins confessed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And say our prayers still hoping for the best.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We fear old age and ugliness and pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love our lives, nor look to live again.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I do but parable the crowd I know,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The human cattle grazing as they go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unheedful of the heavens. Here and there<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some prouder, may be, or less hungry steer<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lifting his face an instant to the sky,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And left behind as the bent herd goes by,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
<span class="i0">Or stung to a short madness, tossing wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His horns aloft, and charging the gay field,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the fence stops him, and he vanquished too,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turns to his browsing&mdash;lost his Waterloo.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The moral of my tale I leave to others<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More bold, who point the finger at their brothers,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And surer know than I which way is best<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To virtue's goal, where all of us find rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether in stern denial of things sweet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or yielding timely, lest life lose its feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fall the further.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i19">A plain tale is mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of naked fact, unconscious of design,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Told of the world in this last century<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of man's (not God's) disgrace, the XIXth. We<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Have made it all a little as it is<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In our own images and likenesses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And need the more forgiveness for our sin.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Therefore, my Muse, impatient to begin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I bid thee fearless forward on thy road:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Steer thou thy honest course 'twixt bad and good.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Know this, in art that thing alone is evil<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shuns the one plain word that shames the devil.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tell truth without preamble or excuse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And all shall be forgiven thee&mdash;all, my Muse!<br /></span>

<div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">In London then not many years ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lived a lady of high fashion, who<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her friends' sake, if any still there be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who hold her virtues green in memory,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shall not be further named in this true tale<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than as Griselda or the Lady L.,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Such, if I err not, was the second name<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her parents gave when to the font she came,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And such the initial letter bravely set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On her coach door, beneath the coronet,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
<span class="i0">Which bore her and her fortunes&mdash;bore, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For, as in this sad world all things must pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">However great and nobly framed and fair:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda, too, is of the things that were.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">But while she lived Griselda had no need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the world's pity. She was proudly bred<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And proudly nurtured. Plenty her full horn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had fairly emptied out when she was born,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dowered her with all bounties. She was fair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As only children of the noblest are,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And brave and strong and opulent of health,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which made her take full pleasure of her wealth.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had a pitying scorn of little souls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And little bodies, levying heavy tolls<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On all the world which was less strong than she.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She used her natural strength most naturally,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet with due discretion, so that all<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stood equally in bondage to her thrall.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
<span class="i0">She was of that high godlike shape and size<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which has authority in all men's eyes:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her hair was brown, her colour white and red,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor idly moved to blush. She held her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Straight with her back. Her body, from the knee<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tall and clean shaped, like some well-nurtured tree,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose finely finished to the finger tips;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had a noble carriage of the hips,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that proportionate waist which only art<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Dares to divine, harmonious part with part.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But of this more anon, or rather never.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that the world could vaunt for its endeavour<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was the fair promise of her ankles set<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon a pair of small high-instepped feet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In whose behalf, though modestly, God wot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As any nun, she raised her petticoat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One little inch more high than reason meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was for one crossing a well-besomed street.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the only tribute she allowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To human folly and the envious crowd;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
<span class="i0">Nor for my part would I be found her judge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For her one weakness, nor appear to grudge<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What in myself, as surely in the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bred strange sweet fancies such as feet suggest.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We owe her all too much. This point apart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda, modesty's own counterpart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved in the sphere of folly like a star,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloof and bright and most particular.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">By girlish choice and whim of her first will<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had espoused the amiable Lord L.,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A worthy nobleman, in high repute<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For wealth and virtue, and her kin to boot;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A silent man, well mannered and well dressed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Courteous, deliberate, kind, sublimely blessed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With fortune's favours, but without pretence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom manners almost made a man of sense.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In early life he had aspired to fame<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the world of letters by the stratagem<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of a new issue, from his private press,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of classic bards in senatorial dress,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
<span class="i0">"<i xml:lang="la" lang="la">In usum Marchionis.</i>" He had spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Much of his youth upon the Continent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Purchasing marbles, bronzes, pictures, gems,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In every town from Tiber unto Thames,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And gaining store of curious knowledge too<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On divers subjects that the world least knew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowledge uncatalogued, and overlaid<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With dust and lumber somewhere in his head.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A slumberous man, in whom the lamp of life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had never quite been lighted for the strife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turmoil of the world, but flickered down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In an uncertain twilight of its own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With an occasional flash, that only made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A deeper shadow for its world of shade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When he returned to England, all admired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The taste of his collections, and inquired<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To whose fair fortunate head the lot should fall<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To wear these gems and jewels after all.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But years went by, and still unclaimed they shone,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
<span class="i0">A snare and stumbling-block to more than one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till in his fiftieth year 'twas vaguely said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord L. already had too long delayed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be it as it may, he abdicated life<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day he took Griselda to his wife.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And then Griselda loved him. All agreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world's chief sponsors for its social creed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That, whether poor Lord L. was or was not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The very fool some said and idiot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or whether under cloak of dulness crass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He veiled that sense best suited to his case,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sparing his wit, as housewives spare their light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For curtain eloquence and dead of night;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And spite of whispered tales obscurely spread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubting the fortunes of her nuptial bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here at this word all sides agreed to rest:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda did her duty with the best.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Yet, poor Griselda! When in lusty youth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A love-sick boy I stood unformed, uncouth,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
<span class="i0">And watched with sad and ever jealous eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The vision of your beauty passing by,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why was it that that brow inviolate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That virginal courage yet unscared by fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That look the immortal queen and huntress wore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To frightened shepherds' eyes in days of yore<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Consoled me thus, and soothed unconsciously,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And stilled my jealous fears I knew not why?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How shall I tell the secret of your soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which then I blindly guessed, or how cajole<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My boyhood's ancient folly to declare<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now in my wisdom the dear maid you were,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Though such the truth?<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i23">Griselda's early days<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of married life were not that fitful maze<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of tears and laughter which betoken aught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Changed or exchanged, of pain with pleasure bought,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of maiden freedom conquered and subdued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of hopes new born and fears of womanhood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Those who then saw Griselda saw a child<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Well pleased and happy, thoughtlessly beguiled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">By every simplest pleasure of her age,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gay as a bird just issued from its cage,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When every flower is sweet. No eye could trace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Doubt or disquiet written on her face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where none there was. And, if the truth be told,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda grieved not that Lord L. was old.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She found it well that her sweet seventeen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should live at peace with fifty, and was seen<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Just as she felt, contented with her lot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Pleased with what was and pleased with what was not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She held her husband the more dear that he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was kind within the bounds of courtesy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And love was not as yet within her plan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And life was fair, and wisdom led the van.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">For she was wise&mdash;oh, wise! She rose at eight<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And played her scales till breakfast, and then sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The morning through with staid and serious looks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Counting the columns of her household books,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Wealth had its duties, time its proper use,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Youth and her marriage should be no excuse;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her education must be made complete!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord L. looked on and quite approved of it.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The afternoons, in sense of duty done,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went by more idly than the rest had gone.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If in the country, which Lord L. preferred,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had her horse, her dogs, her favourite bird,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her own rose-garden, which she loved to rake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her fish to feed with bread crumbs in the lake,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her schools, old women, poor and almshouses,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sick to visit, or her church to dress.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
<span class="i0">Lord L. was pleased to see her bountiful:<br /></span>

<span class="i2">In London, where they spent their second year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came occupations suited to the sphere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In which they lived; and to the just pretence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of our Griselda's high-born consequence,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">New duties to the world which no excuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Admitted. She was mistress of L. House<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And heir to its traditions. These must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Observed by her in due solemnity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her natural taste, I think, repelled the noise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rush, and dust, and crush of London joys;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But habit, which becomes a second sense,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had reconciled her to its influence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Even in girlhood, and she long had known<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That life in crowds may still be life alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">While mere timidity and want of ease<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She never ranked among youth's miseries.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had her parents too, who made demand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon her thoughts and time, and close at hand<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
<span class="i0">Sisters and friends. With these her days were spent<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In simple joys and girlish merriment.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would not own that being called a wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Should make a difference in her daily life.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Then London lacks not of attractions fit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For serious minds, and treasures infinite<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of art and science for ingenious eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And learning for such wits as would be wise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lectures in classes, galleries, schools of art:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Pupil and patron, ay, and patron-saint<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To no few poor who live by pens and paint.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world admired and flattered as a friend,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only wondered what would be the end.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And so the days went by. Griselda's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Calm in its outline of romantic grace,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Became a type even to the vulgar mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all that beauty means when most refined,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
<span class="i0">The visible symbol of a soul within,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And only clothed in our humanity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That we may learn to praise and better be.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where'er she went, instinctively the crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made way before her, and ungrudging bowed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To one so fair as to a queen of earth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ruling by right of conquest and of birth.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And thus I first beheld her, standing calm<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the swayed crowd upon her husband's arm,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">One opera night, the centre of all eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So proud she seemed, so fair, so sweet, so wise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some one behind me whispered "Lady L.!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His Lordship too! and thereby hangs a tale."<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">His Lordship! I beheld a placid man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With gentle deep-set eyes, and rather wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And rather withered, yet on whose smooth face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Time seemed to have been in doubt what lines to trace<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
<span class="i0">Of youth or age, and so had left it bare,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As it had left its colour to his hair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An old young man perhaps, or really old,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which of the two could never quite be told.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I judged him younger than his years gave right:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His looks betrayed him least by candlelight.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet, young or old, that night he seemed to me<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sublime, the priest of her divinity<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At whose new shrine I worshipped. But enough<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of me and my concerns! More pertinent stuff<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My tale requires than this first boyish love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which never found the hour its fate to prove.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My Lady smiling motions with her hand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The crowd falls back; his Lordship, gravely bland,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leads down the steps to where his footmen stay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In state. Griselda's carriage stops the way!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And was Griselda happy? Happy?&mdash;Yes,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">To ask of fate, and not unwilling clings<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To what the present hour in triumph brings.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was enough, as I have said, for her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she was young and fortunate and fair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world that loved her was a lovely world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The rest she knew not of. Fate had not hurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A single spear as yet against her life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would not argue as 'twixt maid and wife,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where both were woman, human nature, man,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which held the nobler place in the world's plan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her soul at least was single, and must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unmated still through its eternity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, even here in life, what reason yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To doubt or question or despair of Fate?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her youth, an ample web, before her shone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For hope to weave its subtlest fancies on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If she had cared to dream. Her lot was good<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beyond the common lot of womanhood,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
<span class="i0">And she would prove her fortune best in this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she would not repine at happiness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thus to her soul she argued as the Spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brought back its joy to each begotten <span class="locked">thing&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">Begotten and begetting. Who shall say<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">In the fourth year a half acknowledged grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made its appearance in Griselda's life.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her sisters married, younger both than she,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Each went her way engrossed by her new bliss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too gay to guess Griselda's dumb distress.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her home was broken. In their pride they wrote<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Things that like swords against her bosom smote,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The detail of their hopes, and loves, and fears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda read, and scarce restrained her tears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her mother too, the latest fledgling flown,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had vanished from the world. She was alone.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">When she returned to London, earlier<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than was her custom, in the following year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She found her home a desert, dark and gaunt;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">L. House looked emptier, gloomier than its wont.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda sighed, for on the table lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Two letters, which announced each in its way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The expected tidings of her sisters' joy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Either was brought to bed&mdash;and with a boy.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her generous heart leaped forth to these in vain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It could not cheat a first sharp touch of pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But yielded to its sorrow.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i26">That same night,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord L., whose sleep was neither vexed nor light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who for many years had ceased to dream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld a vision. Slowly he became<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aware of a strange light which in his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shone to his vast discomfort and surprise;<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
<span class="i0">And, while perplexed with vague mistrusts and fears,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He saw a face, Griselda's face, in tears<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Before him. She was standing by his bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Holding a candle. It was cold, she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And shivered. And he saw her wrap her shawl<br /></span>
<span class="i0">About her shoulders closely like a pall.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why was she there? Why weeping? Why this light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Burning so brightly in the dead of night?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These riddles poor Lord L.'s half-wakened brain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Tried dimly to resolve, but tried in vain.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"I cannot sleep to-night," went on the voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"The streets disturb me strangely with their noise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The cabs, the striking clocks." Lord L.'s distress<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Struggled with sleep. He thought he answered "Yes."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"What can I do to make me sleep? I am ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Unnerv'd to-night. This house is like a well.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
<span class="i0">Do I disturb you here, and shall I go?"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord L. was moved. He thought he answered "No."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"If you would speak, perhaps my tears would stop.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speak! only speak!"<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">Lord L. here felt a drop<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his hand. She had put down the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sat upon his bed forlornly white<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pale and trembling. Her dark hair unbound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lay on her knees. Her lips moved, but their sound<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Came strangely to his ears and half-unheard.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He only could remember the last word:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"I am unhappy&mdash;listen L.!&mdash;alone."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She touched his shoulder and he gave a groan.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"This is too much. You do not hear me. See,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I cannot stop these tears. Too much!"<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i34">And he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now well awake, looked round him. He could catch<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gleam of light just vanished, and the latch<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed hardly silent. This was all he knew.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He sat some moments doubting what to do,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rose, went out, shivered, hearing nothing, crept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Back to his pillow, where the vision wept<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or seemed to weep awhile ago, and then<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With some disquiet went to sleep again.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Next morning, thinking of his dream, Lord L.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Went down to breakfast in intent to tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The story of his vision. But he met<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With little sympathy. His wife was late,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in a hurry for her school of art.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lordship needed time to make a start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On any topic, and no time she gave.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda had appointments she must save,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And could not stop to hear of rhyme or <span class="locked">reason&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The dream must wait a more convenient season.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And so it was not told.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She faced the world, talked much and well, made friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Promoted divers schemes for divers ends,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In face of such a suffering hers must be<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lord L., who had known the prince in other days,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Griselda listened. In her heart there stirred<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The hills of the Campagna crowned with snow<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Listened as to the voice of prophecy,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">With all the zeal of a disciple young<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One which had taught less vigorous wings to fly,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world of other days, the Pagan Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The scarce less Pagan Rome of Christendom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On these the Prince spoke warmly much and well,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Yet broke off smiling when he met her eye<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Fixed on his face in its mute sympathy:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A smile which was a question, an appeal,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He did not understand her quite. He saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Something beyond, unfixed by any law<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of woman's nature his experience knew:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He knew not what to hold or hope as true.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For she was young and sad and beautiful,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
<span class="i0">A very woman with a woman's soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had so strange a pathos in her eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tone so deep, such echoes in her voice.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What was this Roman Hecuba to her?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This prate of consul, pontiff, emperor?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These broken symbols of forgotten pride?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">These ashes of old fame by fame denied?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">What were these stones to her that she should weep,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or spend her passion on a cause less deep<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than her own joys and sorrows? Was it love,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or what thing else had such a power to move?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If there was meaning in red lips! And yet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">'Twere rank impiety to think of it.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">What English virtue dared yet dared not do?<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">This was the thought which lent its mockery<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Her beauty half had kindled into fire.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>

<span class="i2">The fact is, after the first halcyon hour<br /></span>

<span class="i0">This compact with her heart no less than head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Being a woman of much logic sense,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">I think no actual covenant had passed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In words between them either first or last,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But that the Prince, though puzzled and perplexed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had drawn a just conclusion from his text,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And read her meaning, while the hazard made,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of certain idle words at random said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had sapped his confidence, and served to show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If speech were wise, 'twas wiser to forego.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Once too he wrote a sonnet. They had spent<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A poet's pilgrimage to Shelley's <span class="locked">tomb,&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">The holiest spot, Griselda thought, in <span class="locked">Rome,&mdash;</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">This lover of the earth, and sea, and sky;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, reading there and talking in that mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which comes of happiness and youthful blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So near akin to sorrow, their discourse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had touched on human change and pain's remorse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Amid the eternal greenness of the spring;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And, when they came to part, there had seemed to ring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A note of trouble in Griselda's voice,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sigh as if in grief for human joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An echo of unspoken tenderness,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">When they had shaken hands and bid good night.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And so he wrote that evening on the spur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the first tender impulse of the hour<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
<span class="i0">A sonnet to Griselda, a farewell<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Perhaps a declaration; who shall say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whether the thought which lightened into day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between the sorrowing accents of each line,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was more despair or hope which asked a sign?<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Farewell," it said, "although nor seas divide<br /></span>

<span class="i0">For hands to cross, and though we needs must meet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not in a year, a month, but just to-morrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When the first happy instinct of our feet<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bears us together,&mdash;yet we part in sorrow,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bidding good-bye, as though we would repeat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Good-byes for ever. There are gulfs that yawn<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We meet again, but never as to-day."<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">To this Griselda answered nothing. She<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was pleased, yet disconcerted. Poetry<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Is always pleasant to a woman's ear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And to Griselda had been doubly dear,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If it had touched less nearly. But her heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had bounded with too violent a start<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To leave her certain of her self-control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In this new joy which seemed to probe her soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feeling frightened she had tried to find<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A reason for the tumult of her mind<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In being angry. He should not have dared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To strike so near the truth. Or had she bared<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her soul so plain to his that he should speak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of both as an eye-witness? She felt weak<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And out of temper with herself and him,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with the sudden waking from a dream<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
<span class="i0">Too long indulged, and with her own sad fate,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">There yawned indeed a gulf between them. This<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It needed no such word as had been his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To bring back to her memory or show<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How wide it was, and deep, and far below;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet she shuddered, for already thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had led her to the brink where reason fought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With folly, and conjured it to look down<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into the vast and terrible unknown.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was itself an omen.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i24">All that day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda had a headache, and said nay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those who called, the Prince among the rest,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who came distrusting and returned distressed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Awhile this humour lasted. Then they met,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Belgirate, venturing a regret<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Griselda had protested want of time<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
<span class="i0">And want of talent as her sole excuse<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For having made no answer to his Muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet cast withal a look so pitiful<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Upon his face it moved his very soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This closed the incident. He might have spoken<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps that instant, and received some token<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of more than a forgiveness. But his fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had willed it otherwise or willed too late.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For love forgives not, plead it as we may<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To speak the unspoken "Yes" of yesterday.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And dares to have its home in your abodes!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Oh, if I had a soul oppressed with song,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A tongue on fire to prophesy among<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My brother prophets, if I had a hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which needs must write its legend on life's sand<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
<span class="i0">With brush or chisel, I at least would choose<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some soil less fair, less sacred to the Muse,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some younger, wilder land, where no sad voice<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had ever stammered forth its tale of joys,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And loves and sorrows, or in tones less rude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than the brute pulsing of its human blood;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If I would build a temple, it should be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At least not here, not here in Italy,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">No goddess ever leaped, and not in Rome,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beneath the mockery of immortal eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Gazing in marble down, so coldly wise!<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Such was Griselda's thought, which, half aloud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She uttered one May morning 'mid a crowd<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of pleasure-seekers, come from Rome to see<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The wonder of these falls of Tivoli,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
<span class="i0">And Belgirate's villa, where the Prince<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was offering entertainment (for his sins),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dancing to all such as called him friend<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That Spring in Rome, now nearly at an <span class="locked">end;&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thought suggested by the place and by<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A German painter, who undauntedly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was plying a huge canvas just begun,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With brush and palette seated in the sun.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had hardly meant to speak, and when Lord L.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Objected (for he knew his classics well)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That landscape-painting was an unknown trade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the days of Horace, blushed for her tirade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And turned to Belgirate, who stood near,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Playing the host to all the world and her.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">The Prince appealed to, though his care was less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With what was spoken than the speaker's face,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Took up the parable, confessed the truth<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of all each ventured, and agreed with both.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature, he said, and art, though now allied,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had not in all times thus walked side by side.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
<span class="i0">Indeed the love of Nature, now so real,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was alien to the love of the ideal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The classic love which claimed as though of need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some living presence for each fountain-head,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Each grove, each cavern, satyr, nymph, or god,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A human shape unseen yet understood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was the thought which lived in ancient art,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Eschewing the waste places of the heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And only on compulsion brought to face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Brute Nature's aspect in its nakedness.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nature as Nature was a thought too rude<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For these, untempered in its solitude.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It had no counterpart in our new love<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of mountain, sea and forest. Then, each grove<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Asked for its statue, each perennial spring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its fountain. Solitude itself must bring<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its echo. Every mountain top of Greece<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld fair temples rise. A law of peace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reigned over art in protest at the mood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of social life which drenched the world in blood.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All now had been reversed. Our modern creed<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
<span class="i0">Scouted the law that men were born to bleed.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It turned from human nature, if untaught,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And wrought mankind, perhaps and overwrought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Into trim shapes, and then for its relief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Rushed to the wilderness to vent its grief<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In lonely passion. Here it neither sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor found a presence which it needed not.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It chose wild hills and barren seas. It saw<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beauty in tumult, in revolt a law.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here it gave reins to its brute instincts. Here<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It owned no god, no guide, no arbiter.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its soul it must avenge of discipline,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And Nature had gone naked from the shrine.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This was its consolation.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i25">Of the score<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who stood around him and who praised his lore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Perhaps no single listener understood<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Or guessed its bitterness&mdash;not even she<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who lent the moral to his mockery.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
<span class="i0">Yet she was moved. In her too was a need<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of consolation for too fair a creed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An impulse of rebellion. In her blood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There lived a germ of Nature unsubdued,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which would not be appeased. She too had sought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A refuge from the tyranny of thought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the brute impulses of sea and plain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And cloud and forest far from haunts of men.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A vain mad search. The fetters of her pride<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Galled her like sores. Griselda turned and sighed.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">That evening on the terrace, vaguely lit<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With paper lanterns and the infinite<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And 'neath the influence of the planet Mars<br /></span>

<span class="i0">We best may judge by that which came to <span class="locked">pass&mdash;</span><br /></span>

<span class="i0">In vain they stopped, and loitered, and went on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving no trick untried, unturned no stone;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">One little sigh as of relief thus given:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Well, they are gone at last, and thanked be Heaven."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But hour on hour went by, and accident<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Away and speedily.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i19">The Prince, who knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No word of what a storm Fate held in brew,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And who had sought, in innocence of all,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda's hand to lead the opening ball,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sought in vain, now found, to his despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lady cloaked and standing on the stair.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was alone. "Lord L. had gone," she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"To bid the Prince good night. Her foolish head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had played her false, and ached with the new heat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of the May sun (even L. complained of it).<br /></span>
<span class="i0">They must be home betimes. Next day was Sunday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they had much to do 'twixt that and Monday,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In view of their departure." "Whither? whence?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In Heaven's name," exclaimed the astounded Prince.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Why, home to England, she had thought he knew:<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
<span class="i0">She must have told him. L. was more than due<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In London, where his place in Parliament<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Required his presence. He had missed the Lent,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dared not miss the Easter session. She<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Thought he was right, altho',"&mdash;and suddenly<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She burst in tears. The Prince, in dire distress,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besought her to be calm. But she, with face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hid in both hands, and turning from the light,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Broke from his arms, and rushed into the night.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Across the hall, beneath the portico,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And down the steps she fled, to where below<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The garden lay all dim with starlit shade,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the white glimmer of the main façade.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Here Belgirate found her on a seat,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Crouched in an angle of the parapet,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sobbing as in terror. His surprise<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Was changed to resolution. To his eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world became transfigured. "Lady L.,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He whispered, "what is this? You love me? Well,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Why do you weep?"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i20">He took her hands in his<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And pressed them to his lips; and at the kiss<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda started from the heap she was<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sat upright, with pale pathetic face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Turned to the night. By the dim starlight he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Beheld, half-awed and half in ecstasy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The strange emotion of her countenance.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She made no gesture to withdraw her hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No sign of disagreement with his words.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her eyes looked scared and troubled like a bird's<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caught in a net, and seemed to ask of Fate<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where the next blow should fall. 'Twas thus she sat<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Speechless, inanimate, nor seemed to breathe.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prince could hear the chattering of her teeth,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And feel her shiver in the warm night <span class="locked">wind,&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet its touch was hardly thus unkind.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He too, poor soul, in hope and tenderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still kissed her hands, and kissed her gloves and dress,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
<span class="i0">And kneeling at her feet embraced her knees<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With soothing arms and soft cajoleries.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She dared not turn nor speak. The balustrade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Served as a pretext for her with its shade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hiding his face. She would not seem to guess<br /></span>
<span class="i0">All that his fondness asked of her distress:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A word might break the spell. She only knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was a poor sad woman, doomed to do<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Sorrow to all who loved her, that the Prince<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had spoken truly, and her long pretence<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of innocence was o'er. She scorned to make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An idle protest now for honour's sake.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He had a right to ask for what he would<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now that she loved him, and her womanhood<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Reserved one tearful right, and only one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To hide her face an instant and be gone.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">How long they sat thus silent who shall say?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda knew not. Time was far away;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She wanted courage to prepare her heart<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For that last bitterest word of all, "We part;"<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">A sound of music roused them. From the house<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Voices broke in and strains tumultuous,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Proving the dance begun. Then with a sigh<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda turned her head, and piteously<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Looked in his face. She moved as if to go,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when he held her still, "For pity, no,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Let me be gone," she cried. "I ask it thus,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Clasping her hands. "You will not? No! alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must not doubt me when I speak the truth;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">This is a great misfortune for us both."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Griselda," he began. "Oh, stop," she said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You know not what you ask." She bent her head<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Close to his own. "I am not what I seem,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A woman to be loved, not even by him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Whom I might choose to worship. Mine must be<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An unfinished life, not quite a tragedy,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
<span class="i0">Even to my friends, an idle aimless life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Not worth an argument, still less a strife.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You must forget, forgive me. We were friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Friends still perhaps; but, oh! this first day ends<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Our love for ever. What you said was true,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only I never guessed it."<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i25">The Prince knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That she was weeping, and a single sob<br /></span>

<span class="i0">"Yes, I have loved you, loved you from the first,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The day we met at Terni, when you burst<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Like sunshine on the storm of my dark <span class="locked">life&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">You, wise and free&mdash;I, only the sad wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of one you called a friend. The fault was mine<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And mine alone. In you there was no sin:<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">Here again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prince broke in protesting (but in vain):<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her words were madness and his heart was hers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would not listen nor control her <span class="locked">tears&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You never loved me. This one thought I hold<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">She stooped and kissed his forehead reverently,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one would kiss a relic; and when he<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Still would have spoken, stopped him with a hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Laid on his lips, half-prayer and half-command.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She would not let him speak. The prince, tho' mute,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Now pleaded with his hands and pressed his suit<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
<span class="i0">With better eloquence, for this to her<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seemed less a crime than speech. Her ignorant fear<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had hardly fathomed yet the troubled sea<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On which her lot was cast thus dangerously.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She only feared his words to prove him right;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And these caresses in the dim still night<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Soothed and consoled her. They were too unreal,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Too strange to her experience, quite to feel<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or quite to question. She, with half-shut eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And face averted, ceased to feel surprise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And ceased to think. She was a child again,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Caressed and fondled. She forgot her pain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And almost even his presence in the place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He was too near and could not see her face.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Besides, Griselda loved him. Only once<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She made a silent protest with her hands,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As one might make asleep, and in her dream<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Opened her eyes, and seemed to question him<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the pathetic instinct as of doom.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prince in rapture judged his hour was come.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>

<span class="i0">Thine nor Griselda's. Happiness is not<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A merchandise men buy or leave unbought<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And find again. It is a wild bird winging<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its way through heaven, in joyous circles ringing,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Aloft, at its own will. Then, e'er we wist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It stooped and sat a moment on our wrist,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fondled with our fingers, and made play<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With jess and hood as if it meant to stay.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we, if we were wise and fortunate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And if the hour had been decreed of fate,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seized the glad bird and held it in our hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And forced it to obey our least command,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Knowing that never more, if not made sure,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It would come again to voice, or sign, or lure.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">Oh, such is happiness. That night for them<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Mere mortals born, inheritors of clay,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had known eternal life, and been as gods,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the will between them was at odds,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Only the word was wanting.<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Whoever tells it? But there came to both<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment when, as Belgirate knew,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She was no more his love nor he her lover.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
<span class="i0">His courage was exhausted. One by one<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His fingers, which still held Griselda's gown,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I turned impatient. There, behind her fan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">At the far table's end, Griselda's eyes<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Griselda's madness lasted forty days,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forty eternities! Men went their ways,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suns arose and set, and women smiled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And tongues wagged lightly in impeachment wild<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of Lady L.'s adventure. She was gone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">None knew by whom escorted or alone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or why or whither, only that one morning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Without pretext or subterfuge or warning,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had disappeared in silence from L. House,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving her lord in multitudinous<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And agonised conjecture of her fate:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So the tale went. And truly less sedate<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Such as his Garter or his lack of heirs,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
<span class="i0">Lord L. was seen in this new tribulation.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda long had been his life's equation,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The pivot of his dealings with the world,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mainstay of his comfort, all now hurled<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To unforeseen confusion by her flight:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was need of action swift and definite.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where was she? Who could tell him? Divers visions<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And all the hundred accidents of towns,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">From broken axle trees to broken crowns.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In vain he questioned; no response was made<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More than the fact that, as already said,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">My lady, unattended and on foot,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(A sad imprudence here Lord L. took note),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had gone out dressed in a black morning gown<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And dark tweed waterproof, 'twixt twelve and one,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Leaving no orders to her maid, or plan<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A visit of compassion to the poor,<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">It reached my ears among the earliest,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">In evidence above or under ground,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
<span class="i0">But held the case to be of simpler kind,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Lord L. had noticed, now they talked of it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Temper less equable and flightier wit,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"A craving for religious services<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sacred music." Something was amiss,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or why were they in London in September?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda latterly, he could remember,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">She weeping silently, I grieved and wan,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And still he moved not. But with the first break<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of day in the window panes we saw him make<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A sign as if of speaking. Pressing <span class="locked">near&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">For his lips moved, Griselda deemed, in <span class="locked">prayer&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">We heard him make profession of his faith,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As a man of pleasure face to face with death,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A kind of gambler's Athanasian Creed,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
<span class="i0">Repeated at the hour of his last need.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Five sovereigns," said he, steadying his will,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As in defiance of death's power to kill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And with that smile of a superior mind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which was his strength in dealing with mankind,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The world of sporting jargon and gay livers.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Five sovereigns is a fiver, and five fivers<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A pony, and five ponies are a <span class="locked">hundred&mdash;</span><br /></span>
<span class="i0">No, four," he added, seeing he had blundered.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"<i>Four</i> to the hundred and <i>five</i> centuries<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Make up the monkey." From his dying eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The smile of triumph faded. "There, I've done it,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He said, "but there was no great odds upon it,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You see with a broken back."<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i28">He spoke no more,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in another hour had passed the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which shuts the living from eternity.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where was he? God of pity, where was he?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">This was the end of Lady L.'s romance.<br /></span>

<span class="i2">When we had buried him, as they do in France,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In a tomb inscribed "<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">à perpétuité</i>"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">(Formally rented till the Judgment Day),<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She put off black, and shed no further tears;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her face for the first time showed all its years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But not a trace beyond. Without demur<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She gave adhesion to my plans for her,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we went home to London and Lord L.,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Silent together, by the next night's mail.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had been six weeks away.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i30">The interview<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Between them was dramatic. I, who knew<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Her whole mad secret, and had seen her soul<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Stripped of its covering, and without control,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Bowed down by circumstance and galled with shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yielding to wounds and griefs without a name,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Had feared for her a wild unhappy scene.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I held Lord L. for the least stern of men,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
<span class="i0">And yet I dared not hope even he would crave<br /></span>
<span class="i0">No explanation e'er he quite forgave.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">I was with them when they met, unwilling third,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In their mute bandying of the unspoken word.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord L. essayed to speak. I saw his face<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Made up for a high act of tragic grace<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As he came forward. It was grave and mild,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A father's welcoming a truant child,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Forgiving, yet intent to mark the pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With hope "the thing should not occur again."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">His lips began to move as to some speech<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Framed in this sense, as one might gently preach<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A word in season to too gadding wives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of duties owed, at least by those whose lives<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Moved in high places. But it died unsaid.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There was that about Griselda that forbade<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Marital questionings. Her queenly eyes<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Met his with a mute answer of surprise,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
<span class="i0">Marking the unseemliness of all display<br /></span>
<span class="i0">More strongly than with words, as who should say<br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Noblesse oblige.</i> She took his outstretched hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And kissed his cheek, but would not understand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A word of his reproaches. Even I,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With my full knowledge and no more a boy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But versed by years in the world's wickedness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And open-eyed to her, alas! no less<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Than to all womanhood, even I felt shame,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And half absolved her in my mind from blame.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he, how could he less? He was but human,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The fortunate husband of how fair a woman!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">He stammered his excuses.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i27">What she told<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I had left them (since all coin is gold<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those who would believe, and who the key<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Hold of their eyes, in blind faith's alchemy)<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I never learned.<br /></span>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i16">I did not linger on,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Seeing her peril past and the day won,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But took my leave. She led me to the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With her old kindness of the days of yore,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thanked me as one thanks for little things.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"You have been," she said, "an angel without wings,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And I shall not forget,&mdash;nor will Lord L.;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet," she said, with an imperceptible<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Change in her voice, "there are things the world will say<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Which are neither just nor kind, and, if to-day<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We part awhile, remember we are friends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If not now later. Time will make amends,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And we shall meet again." I pressed her hand<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A moment to my lips. "I understand,"<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I said, and gazed a last time in her eyes;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"Say all you will. I am your sacrifice."<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And so, in truth, it was. Henceforth there lay<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A gulf between us, widening with delay,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
<span class="i0">And which our souls were impotent to pass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The gulf of a dead secret; and, alas!<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Who knows what subtle treacheries within,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For virtue rends its witnesses of sin,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And hearts are strangely fashioned by their fears.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">We met no more in friendship through the years,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Although I held her secret as my own,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And fought her battles, her best champion,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">On many a stricken field in scandal's war,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till all was well forgotten. From afar<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I watched her fortunes still with tenderness,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Yet sadly, as cast out of Paradise.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For ever, spite her promise, from that day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When I met L., he looked another way;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And she, Griselda, was reserved and chill.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I had behaved, her women friends said, ill,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And caused a needless scandal in her life,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">&mdash;They told not what. Enough, that as a wife<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had been compelled to close her doors on me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And that her lord knew all the iniquity.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">And so I bore the burden of her sin.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">What more shall I relate? The cynic vein<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Has overwhelmed my tale, and I must stop.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its heroine lived to justify all hope<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Of her long-suffering lord, that out of pain<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Blessings would grow, and his house smile again<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Griselda sat no longer in despair,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Nor wasted her full life on dreams of folly;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She had little time for moods of melancholy,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Or heart to venture further in love's ways;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She was again the theme of all men's praise,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And suffered no man's passion. Once a year,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In the late autumn, when the leaves grew sere<br /></span>
<span class="i0">She made retreat to a lay sisterhood,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And lived awhile there for her soul's more good,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In pious meditation, fasts and prayer.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Some say she wore concealed a shirt of hair<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Under her dresses, even at court balls,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And certain 'tis that all Rome's rituals<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
<span class="i0">Were followed daily at the private Mass<br /></span>
<span class="i0">In her new chauntry built behind Hans Place.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lord L. approved of all she did, even this,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Strange as it seemed to his old fashionedness.<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">He, gentle soul, grown garrulous with years,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A prodigy of beauty and ways sage.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It was a vow, he said, once made in Rome,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">A vow! The light world laughed&mdash;for miracles<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Are not believed in now, except as hell's.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And yet the ways of God are passing strange.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is certain (and therein the range<br /></span>

<span class="i0">&mdash;There is at Ostia, close beside the sea,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A convent church, the same where years ago<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Griselda kneeled in tears and made her vow;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And in that shrine, beneath the crucifix,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
<span class="i0">They show a votive offering, candlesticks<br /></span>
